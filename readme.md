## General
The very first intention of this repo is just for synchronizing my rc files between devices.  
In the later days, more and more mates cloned it for using or picking something helpful.  
Thanks to the practice and suggestions, **shellEnv** is not only a *shell* enviroment more but also containing **shell scripts**, **vim scripts** and so on.  
If you have any sugestions or get any problem, please mail to zhanglue@gmail.com.  
I'm very glad to see your messages.
